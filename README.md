# This repo has been moved to the [dev](http://github.com/cforlando/PetAdoption-API/tree/dev) branch.

## Synopsis

The Pet Adoption API is a project using the ASP.NET WebAPI and MVC stack.  Project is set and built with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as it is open-source. Database and API hosted in Azure Platform.

## Motivation

Nobody likes to see animals be put down due to overcrowding at animal control centers and shelters.  We would like to see animals at these facilities be adopted at a much higher rate, and for those animals who were lost and found, for their rightful owners to be reunited with them once more.  We would like to thank the City of Lady Lake for their wonderful contribution to the project, as they are the project's pilot city.  For that, we are ever grateful!

## Installation

run `npm install`. Sudo privileges may be necessary.

## Tests

***TODO** More tests needed


## Developer Notes
- `gulp-utils` provides easy compilation of javascript, stylus, and pug/jade files.
    + you can can read more about how it works on its [github repo](https://github.com/khalidhoffman/gulp-utils.git)
    + `gulp --tasks` shows a list of all possible tasks, but you'll probably only want to use `gulp build-js`
